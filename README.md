# Heroku Buildpack Multi

This buildpack was deprecated by its maintainer, with instruction that it could be used beyond Jan 1st 2017 by forking and updating the `BUILDPACK_URL`.

For the future, we might want to migrate to use Heroku's [built-in buildpack-multi support](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app).
